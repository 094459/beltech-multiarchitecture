### Building Multiarchitecture Applications

This repo contains the code to build a simple CI/CD pipeline that will build and deploy a simple Spring Boot application, in a multi-architecture cluster containing both x86 and arm based instances.

Please refer to [this blog post](https://dev.to/aws/creating-a-multi-architecture-ci-cd-deployment-for-amazon-ecs-and-ecs-anywhere-15o3) which contains a deep dive on how this code works. This repo has been simplified in that it only deploys the ECS Cluster components and not the local, ECS Anywhere components.
